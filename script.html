                    <p>Gender-Based Violence (GBV) refers to any harmful act directed at an individual based on their gender, resulting in physical, sexual, psychological, or economic harm. Fighting GBV is essential as it violates basic human rights, undermines social progress, and perpetuates inequalities. It is a pressing global issue that requires collective efforts to eliminate.</p>
                    <p>Prevalence of GBV in South Africa: Statistics reveal the urgent need to address GBV in South Africa. According to a study by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), the country experiences high levels of GBV. In 2020, the police recorded 58,344 sexual offenses, and there were 2,695 femicides reported. These alarming numbers underscore the severity of the problem and emphasize the necessity of proactive interventions.</p>
                    <p>K productions is an activist in the fight against GBV. It uses various art forms to highlight some of the subtleties that have become societal norms, which give birth to GBV. Art forms as expressive vehicles allow the audience introspective space using humour as a gateway.</p>

                    <p>Human rights are fundamental principles that acknowledge the inherent value and dignity of every individual. They ensure that individuals are entitled to basic rights and freedoms without discrimination. Human rights encompass civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights that are universally recognized and protected by international law.</p>
                    <p>Upholding human rights is essential for creating a just and equitable society. It promotes respect for individual autonomy, prevents discrimination and injustice, and fosters peaceful coexistence.
